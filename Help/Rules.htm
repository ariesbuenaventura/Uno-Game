    <div align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each 
      player is dealt 7 cards with the remaining ones placed face down to form 
      a &quot;draw&quot; pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned over to 
      begin a &quot;discard&quot; pile. The first player has to match the card 
      in the discard pile either by number, color or word. For example, if the 
      card is a red 7, player must throw down a red card or any color 7. Or the 
      player can throw down a Wild Card. If the player doesn't have anything to 
      match, he must pick a card from the draw pile. If he can play what is drawn, 
      great. Otherwise play moves to the next person. When you have one card left, 
      you must yell &quot;UNO&quot; (meaning one). Failure to do this results 
      in you having to pick two cards from the draw pile. That is, of course if 
      you get caught by the other players. Once a player has no cards left, the 
      hand is over. Points are scored and you start over again.</font></div>
